                                            It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
                                            Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.
                                      
                                            Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
                                            work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
                                            Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
